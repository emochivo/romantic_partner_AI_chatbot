# ROMANTIC PARTNER AI CHATBOT

Date: Jan 9 2025. Written by Chi Vo using the Python programming language and Google Gemini API. 

After downloading this package in your local computer, please also download Python and the following Python libraries: dotenv and google-generativeai. Type these lines into the terminal screen: "pip install dotenv" and "pip install google-generativeai". Then, go to Google AI Studio and get your personal API key; remember to assign the key to the GEMINI_API_KEY variable in the .env file. After finishing the aforementioned steps, you should be able to run the source code (main.py) in your favourite text editor. 

Note: This partner is quite cheesy and may become sexual... You should only try the AI chatbot if you're 16 years old and above :)
